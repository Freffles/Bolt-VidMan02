# Icon Creation Instructions for VidMan Application

For proper packaging and distribution, the application needs platform-specific icon files:

## Required Icon Files

1. Windows: `public/icon.ico`
   - 256x256 pixels (minimum)
   - ICO format

2. macOS: `public/icon.icns`
   - 1024x1024 pixels (recommended)
   - ICNS format

3. Linux: `public/icon.png`
   - 512x512 pixels (recommended)
   - PNG format

## Icon Design Guidelines

- Use a simple, recognizable design
- Ensure the icon works well in both light and dark themes
- Test visibility at smaller sizes
- Maintain consistent branding across platforms

## Conversion Tools

- For Windows (ICO): Use online converters like https://convertico.com/
- For macOS (ICNS): Use `iconutil` command-line tool or online converters
- For all platforms: Consider using Electron Icon Maker (https://github.com/jaretburkett/electron-icon-maker)

## Example Icon Design

A simple video player icon with:
- A dark blue/slate background (#1e293b)
- A white play triangle in the center
- Three blue circles on the left side representing a playlist or controls

This design would be recognizable and work well across all platforms.
